# Repository Overview: Prompt Engineering Exercises - Madeira International Machine Learning Workshop

Welcome to this repository! If you're here, you're likely participating in the Madeira International Machine Learning Workshop. This specific repository contains all the necessary files designed to support the exercises associated with the first part of the "Prompt Engineering" theme.

# What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is a critical facet of working with advanced language models like OpenAI's GPT series. It involves designing, testing, and iterating on prompts to elicit desired outputs from these models. As Machine Learning practitioners, understanding how to craft and refine these prompts effectively can drastically enhance the performance and utility of the models we work with.

# What Can You Find in This Repository?
- A TXT file for each prompt tactic;
- The database used on "Code interpreter" example

# Feedback & Collaboration
Your feedback is invaluable. If you discover any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to share a breakthrough you've had with a particular exercise, please don't hesitate to raise an issue or pull request. Collaboration is the bedrock of the Machine Learning community.

Enjoy your learning journey at the Madeira International Machine Learning Workshop, and may this repository serve as an instrumental guide in your exploration of prompt engineering!
