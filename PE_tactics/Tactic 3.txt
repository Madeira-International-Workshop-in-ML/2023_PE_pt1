“Prompt Engineering is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating software applications to assist in the development of prompt systems. Prompt systems are used to automate the creation of prompts, which are messages or notifications that are sent to users in various contexts.
Prompt Engineering has become increasingly important in recent years, as prompt systems have become more prevalent in various industries. Prompt systems are used in healthcare, education, finance, and many other sectors to provide timely and relevant information to users.
Prompt engineering is not just about designing and developing prompts. It encompasses a wide range of skills and techniques that are useful for interacting and developing with LLMs. It’s an important skill to interface, build with, and understand capabilities of LLMs.”
